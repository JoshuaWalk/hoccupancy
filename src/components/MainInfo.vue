        This site crowdsources real-time capacity data from hospitals treating
        patients with COVID-19. If you have first-hand knowledge of the
        situation at a local hospital, please consider providing a report.
        Please provide an accurate report, even if the information displayed
        here already reflects your experience -- independent confirmation is
        extremely important for the people using this site. As with any
        crowdsourced data, please verify this information with appropriate
        authorities. We cannot guarantee the accuracy of individual reports.

        If you represent a hospital or health authority, please contact the

        This site is a volunteer effort. Covid-19 has demonstrated that our
        society is not well-prepared for emergencies, and that accurate public
        information about the capacity and utilization of critical
        infrastructure is a must. Please consider donating so we can sustain
        this effort. Even a few dollars can help.
        <br />
        <br />
        This site is being actively worked on. Over time we hope to expand its
        scope to other places and types of critical infrastructure. If you have
        any suggestions, questions, or would like to volunteer your help, please
        contact us by email at the address shown at the bottom of this page.
